## TL;DR

Educated in several acronyms across the globe (UNISR, [SFI](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/alumni/jacopo-tagliabue), MIT), I was co-founder and CTO of Tooso, an [AI startup](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3913700/cool-vendors-in-digital-commerce) in San Francisco providing search results and product recommendations to millions of users, before being acquired by [TSX:CVO](https://www.coveo.com/en/company/news-releases/2019/coveo-acquires-tooso).

I led Coveo's AI from scale-up to IPO, and built out _Coveo Labs_, an [applied R&D practice](https://medium.com/the-techlife/applied-research-at-reasonable-scale-8a74d2beed89) rooted in open science: our libraries, models and datasets have collected thousands of stars, raised tens of thousands of dollars in donations, and garnered millions of downloads.

Through my own entrepreneurial journey and constant collaboration with industry (e.g. [Netflix](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11761.pdf), [Farfetch](https://aclanthology.org/2022.ecnlp-1.22/), [NVIDIA](https://rdcu.be/c4dXy)) and academia ([Stanford](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23052-9)), I have been fortunate to work on cutting-edge problems at the intersection of multiple fields: Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Management, Computer Systems, just to name a few. My [papers](#research) are usually characterized by a keen product eye, and are mostly memorable for their titles (e.g. "Not all those who browse are lost", "You don't need a bigger boat", "Mo' models, mo' problems", "Faas and Furious").

While building my new startup, [Bauplan](https://www.bauplanlabs.com/), I moonlight as [Adj. Professor of ML at NYU](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/MLSys-NYU-2022), which is mostly notable because it is the only job I ever had that my parents understand.

### Where is my mind?

I occasionally share [code](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue), [ideas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NDX19U0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [teaching materials](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/MLSys-NYU-2022); if you have no intention of selling me anything, you can also try me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacopotagliabue/).

I often get invited to talk about things I (sort of) know by friends in industry (e.g. Home Depot, Farfetch, eBay, Pinterest, Tubi) and academia (e.g. keynotes at [KDD](public/ADKDD_talk_Aug_2023.pdf), [SIRIP](public/SIRIP_2023_keynote.pdf), [RecSys](https://orsum.inesctec.pt/orsum2023/keynote.php), [CiE](public/are_we_there_yet.pdf)): some of my work is highlighted [below](#appendix).

I recently started investing in startups, both directly and as LP in AI funds: I’m always happy to chat with founders about DataOps, MLOps and AI.

### Research

I have done product-minded research in a (perhaps surprisingly) heterogenous set of of topics: Information Retrieval (e.g. [RecSys](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3383313.3411477), [SIGIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03256)), Machine Learning and model evaluation ([WWW](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09963), [NeurIps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13601), [Nat. Mach. Int.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00606-0)), NLP ([NAACL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.348/), [ACL](https://aclanthology.org/2020.ecnlp-1.2/)), data science ([Nat. Sci. Rep.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23052-9), [KDD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00400)), AI and Large Language Models ([ICML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05863)), data management ([SIGMOD](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3650203.3663335), [VLDB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05368)), human-machine computation ([HCOMP](https://www.humancomputation.com/2019/assets/papers/113.pdf)), computer systems ([WoSC 10](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17465)). Our paper on [cognitively-inspired query embeddings](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-industry.20/) won the Best Paper Award at NAACL 21, and our talk on [reproducible data science on data lakes](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3650203.3663335) won Best Presentation Award at DEEM 24. 

I have been co-organizer of SIGIR eCom (2022, 2023) and EvalRS (2022, 2023), Industry Sponsorship Chair for CIKM 2022, Industry Chair at UMAP (2025), and I have been involved in various organizational capacities in several top-tier research events (COLING, EMNLP, ACL, SIRIP, ECONLP, ECNLP).

As a true Santa Fe Institute alumnus, I am an old-fashioned generalist, and I gave tiny contributions to other fields mostly as an excuse to spend time with old friends: [logic and computation](https://academic.oup.com/logcom/article-abstract/32/6/1129/6548838?redirectedFrom=fulltext), [cellular automata](https://philpapers.org/archive/BERTPO-77.pdf), [computational social sciences](https://books.openedition.org/ifea/6587?lang=en), [networks](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-017-0029-0), [philosophy of mind](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-013-9332-4), [political science](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23248823.2023.2175124), [digital ethics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-023-09644-y).

Finally, some of my research projects have been [patented](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=jacopo+tagliabue&oq=jacopo+tagliabue), but nobody to this day seems to really know why.

## Old stuff

In previous lives, I managed to get a Ph.D., simulate a pre-Columbian civilization, document biases in national elections and give an academic talk on videogames. Some of my improbable "achievements" received [ample](http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/13_settembre_18/ciclobby-censimento-biciclette-mobilita-sostenibile-2223163930809.shtml) [press](public/il_foglio_02_2023.pdf) [coverage](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/06/coveo-raises-227m-at-1b-valuation-for-ai-based-enterprise-search-and-personalization/). 

Having built end-to-end data pipelines at garage, growth and IPO scale, I happily shared all my mistakes in a series of [articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/mlops-without-much-ops) that introduced the concept of _Reasonable Scale_.

Some time before [Brad Pitt's movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)), I led one of the first attempts of running sophisticated analytics for a professional basketball [team](http://www.olimpiamilano.com/en/), and spearheaded the first [data science](https://vimeo.com/74664341) effort on Milan's [bike-sharing service](public/PedalaMi.pdf) (no bikers or bureaucrats were harmed during the project).
